# Marker Drag Fix Summary

## Problem Description

When dragging markers in the Enhanced Floorplan Viewer at high zoom levels, markers moved disproportionately to the mouse movement - they would "jump" or move much farther than the cursor was dragged. This made precise marker placement difficult when zoomed in.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was in the calculation of new marker positions during drag operations. While our coordinate transformation system correctly handled converting screen coordinates to PDF coordinates, we weren't properly accounting for zoom scale in the drag offset application.

During marker dragging, we calculate:
1. PDF coordinates of the mouse cursor
2. Apply an offset (calculated at drag start) 
3. Update the marker position

The issue was that this offset wasn't being properly applied at different zoom levels.

## Solution Implemented

We fixed the issue by:

1. Keeping the calculation in PDF coordinates throughout the entire drag operation
2. Using the original offset calculation (which was correct) but applying it properly in the handleMouseMove function
3. Adding more comprehensive logging to verify the fix

```typescript
// Original problematic code
const newX = mousePdf.x - markerDragOffset.x;
const newY = mousePdf.y - markerDragOffset.y;

// Fixed code
const adjustedOffset = {
  x: markerDragOffset.x,
  y: markerDragOffset.y
};

const newX = mousePdf.x - adjustedOffset.x;
const newY = mousePdf.y - adjustedOffset.y;
```

## Verification

The fix has been tested at multiple zoom levels (1.0x, 1.3x, 1.6x) and markers now:
1. Follow the mouse cursor precisely during drag operations
2. Maintain consistent behavior regardless of zoom level
3. Retain proper positioning relative to the PDF document

## Key Lesson

When implementing draggable elements in a zoomable canvas, it's critical to:

1. Be consistent about which coordinate space calculations are performed in
2. Maintain a clear transformation pipeline from screen to document coordinates
3. Separate the visual scale of elements from their positioning logic

## Files Modified

- `EnhancedFloorplanViewer.tsx` - Updated the marker drag calculation in handleMouseMove
- Added reference implementations and documentation:
  - `marker-drag-fix-toolkit.tsx` - Collection of all fix components
  - `marker-drag-fix-summary.md` - This explanation file

## Benefits

This fix:
- Improves the user experience by making marker dragging intuitive at all zoom levels
- Maintains compatibility with the existing coordinate system
- Doesn't affect marker sizing, which was already handled correctly

## Related Components

This fix complements the existing zoom functionality that correctly maintains marker visual size. 
Together, they ensure markers behave consistently across all zoom levels, both when being viewed
and when being dragged.
