# Supabase Setup Instructions

Your app has been migrated to use Supabase for all storage needs. To complete the setup, you need to configure your Supabase database.

## 1. Set up Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard (supabase.com)
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` file
4. Run the SQL to create all necessary tables and policies

## 2. Configure Storage Buckets

The SQL script will automatically create two storage buckets:
- `project-files`: For documents and files
- `project-images`: For photos and images

## 3. Current Features

Your app now supports:

### ✅ Local-First Storage
- Works offline with IndexedDB
- Automatically syncs when online
- Stores data locally on user's device

### ✅ Cloud Sync
- Syncs to Supabase when connected
- Real-time data updates
- Secure file and image storage

### ✅ Authentication
- Supabase Auth integration
- User registration and login
- Session management

### ✅ File Management
- Upload files and images
- Automatic compression and thumbnails
- Cloud storage with local fallback

## 4. Migration Benefits

- **Offline Support**: App works without internet connection
- **Data Security**: Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Scalability**: Cloud storage handles any amount of data
- **Reliability**: Automatic sync and backup
- **Performance**: Local data for instant access

## 5. Next Steps

Once you've run the SQL schema in Supabase:
1. Your app will automatically use the new storage system
2. All new data will be stored both locally and in the cloud
3. Users can work offline and sync when connected

The app maintains all existing functionality while adding robust offline capabilities and cloud storage.
