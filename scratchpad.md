## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **PDF Rendering** - PDF.js requires proper cleanup of rendering tasks to prevent memory leaks and rendering conflicts. Always cancel previous render tasks before starting new ones.

2. **Coordinate Systems** - Maintaining a consistent coordinate system between different spaces (PDF space, screen space, viewport space) is critical for reliable marker positioning. Using a single scale factor and applying it consistently is essential.

3. **SVG Manipulation** - SVG offers powerful features for annotations but requires careful handling of coordinate spaces and transformations. Using SVG groups (`<g>`) with transforms helps organize and manipulate elements more easily.

4. **React Performance** - For complex rendering like PDFs and annotations, it's important to carefully manage state updates and use useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

5. **TypeScript Type Safety** - Proper type definitions prevent many runtime errors, especially when dealing with complex data structures like markers, annotations, and equipment configurations.

### Architectural Insights
1. **State Management** - Using a combination of React Context and TanStack Query provides an effective pattern for managing both local UI state and server data.

2. **API Design** - Well-designed API endpoints that follow REST principles make client-side integration much easier and more predictable.

3. **Database Schema** - A properly normalized database schema prevents data inconsistencies and simplifies query logic.

4. **Component Decomposition** - Breaking down complex components (like the floorplan viewer) into smaller, focused components improves maintainability and reduces cognitive load.

### Process Insights
1. **Incremental Development** - Building features incrementally and testing thoroughly at each step prevents cascading failures and makes debugging easier.

2. **Error Tracking** - Comprehensive error tracking and logging are essential for quickly identifying and resolving issues, especially for complex interactions like PDF manipulation.

3. **User Feedback** - Regular testing with real users helps identify usability issues that may not be obvious during development.

4. **Documentation** - Maintaining up-to-date documentation on complex systems (like coordinate transformations) is crucial for maintaining and extending the codebase.

## Critical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: PDF Rendering Performance
**Solution:** Implemented careful cancellation of in-progress render tasks and optimized scale factor calculations to improve rendering performance and prevent visual glitches.

### Challenge: Marker Positioning
**Solution:** Developed a consistent coordinate transformation system that correctly maps between PDF coordinates and screen coordinates regardless of zoom level or panning.

### Challenge: Complex User Interactions
**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive tool mode system that cleanly separates different interaction modes (select, draw, resize, etc.) while maintaining a consistent user experience.

### Challenge: Data Model Complexity
**Solution:** Created a flexible and extensible marker data model that accommodates different marker types while maintaining consistent behavior for shared operations.

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement marker duplication functionality
2. Add option to hide/show specific marker types
3. Enhance export options (with/without markers)
4. Fix remaining type safety issues in the codebase
5. Implement voice interaction capabilities for the AI chatbot
