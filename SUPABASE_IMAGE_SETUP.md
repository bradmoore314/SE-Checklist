- **Allowed MIME types**: 
  - `image/png`
  - `image/jpeg` 
  - `image/jpg`
  - `image/gif`
  - `image/webp`

### 3. Set Storage Policies (if needed)
If you encounter permission issues, you may need to set up Row Level Security policies:

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies**
2. Look for **storage.objects** table
3. Create policies for:
   - **SELECT**: Allow public read access to equipment-images bucket
   - **INSERT**: Allow authenticated users to upload to equipment-images bucket

### 4. Test the Upload
Once the bucket is created:
1. Go to any camera in your project
2. Click the upload button (ðŸ“¤)
3. Select image files
4. The upload should work automatically
