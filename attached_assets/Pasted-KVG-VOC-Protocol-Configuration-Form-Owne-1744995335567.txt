VOC Monitoring Action/Response Plan													
													
	Description:												
	This is used to identify all the incident types based on the customers Use Case Problems called out in 4. Use Case Design - SOW - SME. Typically the Incident Type should align with a standard VOC Response Action that can be supported via KVG services. You may complete this based on Incident types tied to specific cameras or patrol groups to the selection of cameras. In the event it does not align with a current VOC Incident Type and Response Action, it needs to be reviewed and approved before it is delivered/committed to the customer. See tab 4 for the information on what is needed for the VOC team as it relates to Use Case, Response, Video Stream Naming, Event Analytics, Patrol Groups, schedules and suggested dwell times.
