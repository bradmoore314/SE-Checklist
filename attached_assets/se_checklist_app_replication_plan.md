# SE Checklist App Replication Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for replicating the SE Checklist Excel spreadsheet as a modern web application. Based on the detailed analysis of the spreadsheet's structure, functionality, and data flow, this plan provides a roadmap for developing a more robust, user-friendly, and scalable solution that maintains all the core functionality of the original spreadsheet while adding improvements that would be difficult to implement in Excel.

The proposed application will follow a modern web architecture with a database backend, API layer, and responsive frontend. It will maintain the data relationships, validation rules, and calculation logic of the original spreadsheet while improving usability, collaboration features, and reporting capabilities.

## Core Functionality Requirements

Based on the spreadsheet analysis, the following core functionality must be replicated in the app:

1. **Project Configuration Management**
   - Project metadata (site address, project name, SE, BDM)
   - Configuration toggles (currently Yes/No options in Overview sheet)
   - Initial setup parameters

2. **Security Equipment Specification**
   - Card access system configuration
   - Camera system specification
   - Elevator and turnstile access control
   - Intercom systems
   - Miscellaneous equipment

3. **Standardized Option Selection**
   - Dropdown menus with predefined options
   - Validation against standardized lists
   - Categorized selection options

4. **Calculation Engine**
   - Data transformation logic
   - Conditional calculations
   - Cross-reference lookups
   - Formula-based derivations

5. **Reporting and Output Generation**
   - Door schedules
   - Camera schedules
   - Equipment lists
   - Project summaries

## Technical Architecture
