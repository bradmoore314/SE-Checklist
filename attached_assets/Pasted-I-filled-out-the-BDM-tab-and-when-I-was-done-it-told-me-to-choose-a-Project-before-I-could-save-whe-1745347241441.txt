I filled out the BDM tab and when I was done it told me to choose a Project before I could save, when I went to choose a project I had to create new and it did not save my entries from the BDM tab
BDM Tab
- Opportunity Details:
Missing MidAtlantic in the Region Dropdown,
It has Southeast and Southwest vs South and/or Central
It does not have Enterprise, Greater Philadelphia or Mutual Statland

BDM: Technology & Installation 

 


We are missing the Services Recommended selection, this is what it should be


- Technology is the wrong options, this is what it should be


Incident Types to Monitor:
We should have a more prominent highlight when selecting an incident type

Site Assessment SE Tab
 
Stream Counts should be a drop down scroll vs an individual up/down arrow - I guess it is ok as you can manually enter values
The Site Assessment tab is missing the Site Plan input or link, the BOM input or link, I think these are in different tabs
This calls out from some extra info that I need to look into for the Stream Counts and the Monitoring details
 
Stream Tab

I clicked "add my first stream" and it took me to an empty landing page

When I went back to the landing page and chose the Project it took me back to the KVG page but the blank one - after I refreshed it loaded but a new project not my old one
I noticed that "Add Stream" worked though

Camera Type need to be expanded and they should say stream
Indoor Fixed Single Lens, Outdoor Fixed Single Lens, Indoor Fisheye Pano/Quad, Outdoor Fisheye Pano/Quad, Indoor Multi-Sensor Stream, Outdoor Multi-Sensor Stream, Thermal, Radiometric, PTZ
FOV Accessibility says Yes or No vs the different Environments


Need to add Health Monitoring as it goes with Event streams if there are no patrols for those streams. This would allow you to select Health Monitoring which should be a default and a selection for number of camera streams.
Need to have a Monitored Schedule field to fill in under detailed Info if its is a complex schedule with weekday vs weekend schedules
In the detailed info there is an option for Patrol and it opens another monitoring schedule. We should have the ability to set Patrol Monitoring vs Event Monitoring. I would suggest bringing that up to Patrols and shifting the current monitoring to Event Monitoring Times

The monitoring time defaults to a 20 min option vs a 00, that would be best.


When I try and add an image for the camera in the Camera stream area, it says I need to save stream before I can, where do you save the stream? I left the tab and came back but it did the same thing.

I tried to navigate backwards and it took me out of the app to the sign-in page and it did not work with my registered acct I setup and could not get back to my Project I created.
