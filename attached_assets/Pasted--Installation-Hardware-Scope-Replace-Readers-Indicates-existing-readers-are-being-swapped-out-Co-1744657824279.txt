üîß Installation/Hardware Scope
Replace Readers?
Indicates existing readers are being swapped out. Costs depend on compatibility with existing infrastructure (e.g., backbox size, wiring) and may require trim plates or rework if the form factor differs.

Install Locks?
Adds labor and material costs for electric locks (e.g., strikes, maglocks). Also increases scope due to the need for door prep, power supplies, and potential coordination with locksmiths or GCs.

Pull Wire?
Signals that we‚Äôre responsible for running cable ‚Äî adds significant labor, materials, and possibly lift equipment. Impacts timeline, especially in finished spaces or plenum ceilings.

Wireless Locks?
Suggests a different install approach ‚Äî fewer wires but higher hardware cost. May require additional gateways and power considerations. Can simplify install but complicate system design.

Conduit Drawings?
Required when electrical trades or permitting demand documentation of raceways. Adds engineering or design time, typically involves CAD work, and may require coordination with electrical subcontractors.

üîê Access Control / Identity Management
Need Credentials?
Triggers the need to quote cards/fobs/mobile credentials. Impacts both hardware costs and ongoing credential management requirements.

Photo Id?
Suggests integration with photo capture or badge printing systems. Adds hardware (camera, badge printer) and software licensing costs, plus labor to configure.

Photo Badging?
Indicates that the system will need to produce printed credentials. Adds complexity to the quote with badge printers, consumables, and potential software requirements.

BLE?
Mobile credentialing support impacts hardware (readers must support BLE), licensing, and ongoing app fees. Also may require customer training or setup.

Test Card?
Required for reader alignment or troubleshooting. May indicate that a validation step is needed post-installation, which could mean a return trip or additional onsite time.

Visitor?
If visitor management is required, it may trigger additional hardware (e.g., visitor kiosks, printers), software modules, or integrations.

Guard Controls?
May involve panic buttons, override switches, or custom interfaces for security personnel. Increases design and wiring complexity, and may require consultation with on-site staff.

üèóÔ∏è Site Conditions / Project Planning
Floorplan?
Absence of a floorplan complicates scoping ‚Äî SEs may need to create one, or risk underquoting due to unknowns. Presence of a plan helps with accuracy and efficiency.

Reports Available?
If system reports are available (from an existing access control system), we can use them to validate quantities and locations, improving quoting accuracy and reducing surprises.

Kastle Connect?
Refers to our managed connectivity solution. Impacts pricing model, removes dependency on client internet, and adds recurring and equipment costs.

On Site Security?
If a guard is present during install, this may affect access to spaces or allow for faster coordination. Alternatively, if required, it may add cost or scheduling restrictions.

Takeover?
Indicates we‚Äôre inheriting existing hardware. This increases uncertainty and can lead to rework or incompatibility issues, so a contingency buffer or detailed assessment is often needed.

Rush?
Affects labor pricing and scheduling. May trigger overtime rates, prioritization fees, or require pulling resources from other jobs.

PPI Quote Needed?
Means we need to get pricing from a third party (usually a certified installer or product partner). Adds time to the quoting process and may introduce variables we can‚Äôt fully control.
