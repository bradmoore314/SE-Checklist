Below is a parity checklist developed by ripping apart Bluebeam Revu’s feature matrix and mapping every line item to concrete work you’d still need after Phase 1–8. Treat it as your product backlog; when every box is green you’re‑there‑or‑better.


Domain	What Bluebeam does	What you still need to ship
Core PDF editing	‑ Page insert, delete, rotate, reorder
‑ Combine / split PDFs
‑ Page labels & bookmarks
‑ OCR & full‑text search inside scanned drawings	🔲 Sidebar with page list → drag‑drop reorder ⇄ pdf-lib
🔲 Bookmark panel; allow “create from text selection”
🔲 OCR pipeline (Tesseract‑wasm or Azure Computer Vision) → search index; highlight search hits
🔲 Batch combine / split wizard
Markup palette	Saved tool sets, custom stamps, date/time stamps	🔲 “Tool Chest” modal that lets users drag mark‑ups back to save as reusable presets (persist JSON per user)
🔲 Dynamic stamp designer → flatten timestamp & user info
Measurement pro	Area, perimeter, volume, wall area, count; custom columns (e.g., cost code), Excel live‑link	🔲 Finish area/volume tools (poly with cut‑outs + height input)
🔲 Custom property schema per measurement + CSV/XLSX export
🔲 WebSocket bridge or Excel‑JS add‑in to sync quantities live
Precision aids	Snap to content, snap to markup, snap to grid; ortho & angle lock; rulers & guides	🔲 Content‑snap: use pdf.js Page.getOperatorList() to pull path vertices into an R‑tree for hit‑testing
🔲 Toggleable grid + spacing prefs stored per‑doc
🔲 Rulers along canvas edges & cross‑hair cursor
Document comparison	Overlay Pages (color‑coded) and Compare Documents (clouds all changes)	🔲 Raster overlay: render both pages to off‑screen canvases → difference blend; tint with CSS filters
🔲 Change cloud diff: pixel diff → marching‑squares → auto create “revision cloud” polygon annotations
Batch processes	Batch link (auto‑hyperlink call‑outs), batch slip‑sheet, batch sign & seal	🔲 Regular‑expression search on text layer → auto‑create <a> links
🔲 Slip‑sheet wizard: upload new set, match page labels, carry markups forward
🔲 DSS‑compliant digital signature panel (PKCS#7 via node‑pkcs7).
Collaboration	Studio Sessions: real‑time multi‑user, per‑markup authorship, chat, permissions	🔲 CRDT or Y‑js layer on top of annotation store → broadcast via WebSocket
🔲 Per‑markup author_id, locking, and change log
🔲 Right‑hand chat panel scoped to doc or selection
Performance at scale	Opens 500‑page, 500 MB sets; smooth pan/zoom	🔲 Tile renderer with auto‑drop of resolutions > 3× screen DPI
🔲 LRU cache of OffscreenCanvas bitmaps
🔲 Worker pool for measurement math & diff so main thread stays < 16 ms
Mobile parity	Pinch‑zoom, Apple Pencil pressure, offline “field” mode	🔲 pointerrawupdate + pressure for pen ink; velocity‑based smoothing
🔲 Service‑worker cache of PDFs & annotations for offline use; sync queue when online
Security / compliance	Password‑protection, redaction, digital IDs, FIPS, SOC2	🔲 Implement redact tool → draw rect → burn white boxes into page stream via pdf-lib
🔲 AES‑256 encrypted storage of PDFs at rest; field‑level ACL checks on API
🔲 SOC‑2 logging hooks & audit trails
Automation / scripting	Batch script runner, JavaScript in PDF actions	🔲 Expose a tiny domain‑specific language (or JSON recipe) to run headless ops (flatten, combine, stamp, export CSV) – execute server‑side with Node
User‑experience polish	The “it feels right” bits	🔲 Cursor changes for every tool; ghost previews while drawing
🔲 Animated zoom (ease‑out) and inertial pan
🔲 Keyboard map identical to Bluebeam defaults + customisable
On‑boarding & help	In‑app tutorials, cheat‑sheet, templates	🔲 Coach‑marks the first time each tool is used; “Press Shift to snap 90°” call‑out
🔲 Sample construction PDF & saved tool set pre‑loaded
Engineering infrastructure you’ll thank yourself for
E2E tests with Playwright that load a 300‑page plan set, scribble, measure, undo/redo, export, and pixel‑compare against golden images.

Performance budget CI step: fail PR if time‑to‑first‑page > 2 s on a 10‑year‑old laptop.

Feature flag system (LaunchDarkly or home‑grown) so you can gate large chunks (e.g., OCR, live‑collab) for beta users.

Suggested delivery order after Phase 8
Snap & guides (content + grid) – indispensable for precise take‑offs.

Batch slip‑sheet & overlay compare – the top “Revu”‑only workflows GC’s love.

OCR + search – makes scanned plan sets actually usable.

Live collaboration – differentiator vs. plain web viewers.

Security / redaction / signatures – must‑have for enterprise roll‑out.
