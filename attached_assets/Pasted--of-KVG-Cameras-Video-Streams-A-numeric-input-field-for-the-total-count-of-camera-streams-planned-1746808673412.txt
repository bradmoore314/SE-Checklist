# of KVG Cameras Video Streams: (A numeric input field for the total count of camera streams planned)
Site and Scene Activity Notes: (A dedicated, prominent multi-line text area for general notes about site activity, restricted areas, and operational context, distinct from "Schedule Notes")
(Consider) Reviewer(s): (If tracking reviewers directly within this form is a requirement, add a field for this, e.g., text input or multi-select. If not, this can be omitted).
(Consider) Additional Custom Incident Type Placeholders: (Evaluate if more than the current 3 "Custom Incident Type" slots are needed, or if users need the ability to add them more contextually within the incident list, similar to Dataset 1's multiple "fill in if incident type not shown" fields).
Please REMOVE these fields:
(Based on the goal of matching Dataset 1 more closely, there aren't fields in Dataset 2 that need outright removal if the aim is to be comprehensive. Dataset 2 has introduced fields that are logical additions for an app, like "Quote Date," "Region," "Customer Vertical," etc. These don't directly conflict with Dataset 1, but rather expand on it. If the strict goal is only to replicate Dataset 1, then these would be candidates for removal, but they seem like useful additions for a modern application).
No fields are explicitly recommended for removal if the goal is to have a comprehensive app that also covers Dataset 1's core information. The new fields in Dataset 2 (e.g., Quote Date, Region, Customer Vertical, Property Category, Technology Deployed, Install Type, GDODs Dispatches Per Month, SGPP Scheduled Patrols Per Month) are generally additive and useful for a digital system.
Clarification/Refinement Notes:
Instructional Text: While not "fields," ensure that crucial instructional text and context from Dataset 1 (e.g., purpose of the form, guidance on filling out sections) are incorporated into Dataset 2 through help icons, tooltips, or brief section descriptions.
"Send to KVG Team...": This instruction from Dataset 1 likely translates to a workflow step (e.g., a "Submit" or "Finalize for Review" button) in the app, rather than a data field.
This should help ensure that the core non-camera-specific information captured in the original spreadsheet is also comprehensively covered in the new application.
